# Welcome to Project Baseline!
Welcome to my slice of the internet, Project Baseline. This is my testing site for web development. Have a look around!
If you plan on making your own things on this, add your own branch, preferably *(username)-edit, (username)-patch-(number), (username)-update-(number)*, etc. Then add a folder for the things you're making (or update things with problems) and post a pull request.
